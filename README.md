## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/josotieno/make-your-game.git
```

### 2. Launch the Game
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser, or
- Use a Live Server extension in your code editor for an enhanced development experience.

## Controls

- **Move Left/Right:** Use `←/→` keys or `A/D`
- **Fire:** Press the `Space` key
- **Pause:** Hit `Escape`

## Flow of Code
The core logic is divided into several key sections:
- **Initialization:** Setup of the canvas, game variables, and initial state.
- **Input Handling:** Event listeners capture user inputs to control the ship.
- **Game Loop:** A continuous loop updates positions, processes collisions, and handles dynamic difficulty adjustments.
- **Rendering:** The game engine redraws the canvas with each frame, incorporating animations and sound effects.
- **State Management:** A simple state machine navigates between game menus, active gameplay, and pause states.
